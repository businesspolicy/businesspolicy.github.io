## Introduction to Portfolio Analysis

The global and corporate strategy discussion in this module introduces a sequence of critical business decisions and frameworks that help in making those decisions. The core of this project is about identifying those decisions in your company via historical analysis, understanding the value creation and competitive advantage rationale behind those decisions, and finally evaluating whether those choices are still optimal under the current business environment. This guide aims to help you be successful in this project. This guide has five major sections: research tips, historical corporate event analysis, organizational structure analysis, competitive advantage/value creation analysis, and current portfolio evaluation.

Below you will find a brief summary of each section. Click on the links to access the detailed guidance for each part of the project.
