# **Portfolio Analysis of Your Company**
{: .no_toc}


## Introduction to Portfolio Analysis

We previously focused on analyzing the external and internal environment of a business unit to understand how it creates value and achieves a competitive advantage. Those modules introduced frameworks that helped us understand the market power and business model choices of our project companies. This module will focus on portfolio-level analysis, where we aim to better understand our project companies as portfolios of strategic business and geographic units.

The global and corporate strategy discussion in this module introduces a sequence of critical business decisions and frameworks that help in making those decisions. The core of this project is about identifying those decisions in your company via historical analysis, understanding the value creation and competitive advantage rationale behind those decisions, and finally evaluating whether those choices are still optimal under the current business environment. This guide aims to help you be successful in this project. This guide has four major sections: research tips, historical corporate event analysis, organizational structure analysis, and current portfolio evaluation.
