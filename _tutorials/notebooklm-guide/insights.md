# Note that Insight

## Note that Insight!

In NotebookLM, notes are where you capture and organize your key findings and insights. Think of them as your research hub within the notebook.

### What is a Note?

In general, a note is a record of something importantâ€”an idea, a fact, a question, or a reminder.  In NotebookLM, notes serve a few special purposes:

* **Capturing Ideas:** You can create blank notes to jot down your own thoughts, questions, or summaries as you work through your research. This is like your personal research journal within the notebook.
* **Saving Answers:** When you get a helpful response from the chat, you can save it as a note to refer to later. These notes are a record of the AI's analysis of your sources.
* **Building on Insights:** You can even turn your notes *into* sources, allowing you to combine your own thinking with the information from your original documents.

### A Research Workflow with Notes

Here's how you can use notes to power your research projects:

1. **Define Your Questions:** Start by breaking down your research topic into a set of clear research questions.
2. **Gather Information:** Use NotebookLM's chat and source overview features to find answers to your questions.
3. **Capture Key Findings:**
   * Save helpful chat responses as notes.
   * Create your own notes to record your own insights, interpretations, or questions that arise.
4. **Organize Your Notes:** Use note titles within the Studio panel to organize your notes into a meaningful structure.
5. **Summarize and Share:**
   * Use NotebookLM's summary features (audio overview, FAQ, briefing docs, timeline) to create summaries of your findings.
   * Consider using the "Customize Audio Overview" option in the audio overview to tailor the summary to specific aspects of your research.

    > Here's a description of each preset:
    > 
    > *   **FAQ** generates a list of ten frequently asked questions with answers for the sources you uploaded.
    > *   **Study Guide** converts your source material into three parts that are helpful for learning: a short answer quiz with an answer key, a suggested list of long-form essay questions, and a glossary of key terms.
    > *   **Briefing Doc** takes the key facts or insights from your sources and presents them in an easy-to-understand outline.
    > *   **Timeline** generates a chronological list of all the important events mentioned in your sources. It also makes a "cast of characters" with short bios for all the important people mentioned in your sources. 
    > *   **Audio Overview** translates your source material into a conversation between two AI hosts in the style of a podcast.

6. **Refine and Iterate:**
   * If the preset summaries don't perfectly fit your needs, you can create your own summaries based on your notes.
   * You can also amass a collection of notes, remove the original source materials, convert the notes into sources, and then use NotebookLM to generate a new summary based on your refined insights.

### NotebookLM's Role in your Research Project


NotebookLM makes this entire process smoother and more efficient by:

* **Providing a Central Hub:**  It acts as a container for all your sources, regardless of their format, making it easy to manage and analyze diverse information.
* **Enhancing Understanding:** The source overview feature gives you a quick grasp of each document's key takeaways.
* **Facilitating Exploration:** The chat functionality allows you to ask questions and get answers conversationally. 
* **Supporting Your Thinking:**  You can record your own ideas and reflections in notes, creating a dynamic research journal.
* **Summarizing and Reporting:**  The built-in summary features help you synthesize your findings and share them with your audience.

> What is a Source Overview?
> 
> A source overview is a summary of a document that you upload or paste into NotebookLM. NotebookLM creates a source overview automatically when you upload a new source. The purpose of a source overview is to help you understand the source material better by summarizing the document and suggesting key topics and questions.
