# Five Forces Analysis

1.  **Define the Industry:**
    *   Clearly define the boundaries of the industry you're analyzing.
    *   Refer to the "Industry Analysis" reading for guidance on factors to consider, such as customer needs, technology, and the competitive landscape.
    *   **Example:** If your company is a social media platform, you might define the industry as "social networking platforms" or "online content sharing platforms".

1.  **Identify the Players:**
    *   Identify the key players in each of the five forces:
        *   **Rivalry:** Direct competitors within the industry.
        *   **New Entrants:** Potential new competitors that could enter the market.
        *   **Substitutes:** Products or services that could fulfill similar customer needs.
        *   **Buyers:** The customers or users of the industry's products or services.
        *   **Suppliers:** The providers of inputs or resources to the industry.
        *   **Complementors:** The creators of products that can increase the wedge between suppliers' opportunity cost and customers' willingness-to-pay in the focal industry.

3.  **Analyze the Strength of Each Force:**
    *   Evaluate the strength of each force using the factors described in the "Industry Analysis" reading (e.g., industry concentration, switching costs, barriers to entry).
    *   Helpful Hints: 
        - Start with the overall effect of the force and explain it using observations about the concentration, switching costs, and barriers to entry.
        - Use relevant quanitative data such as [concentration ratio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_ratio) to describe the factors that explain the overall effect. See financial benchmarks section of [IBISWorld reports](http://pitt.idm.oclc.org/login?url=https://my-ibisworld-com.pitt.idm.oclc.org/) for key ratios that could be used for this purpose.
        - Make sure to analyze the impact on customers' willingness-to-pay and suppliers' opportunity costs. 


4.  **Assess Overall Industry Attractiveness:**
    *   Based on your analysis, determine the overall attractiveness of the industry in terms of profit potential.
    *   Consider how the five forces collectively impact profitability.
    *   Please remember not all forces have equal impact on all industries. Your evaluation of five forces must describe the varying importance of five forces and account for it.
