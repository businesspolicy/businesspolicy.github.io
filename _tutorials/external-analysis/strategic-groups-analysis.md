1.  **Map Strategic Groups:**
    *   Create a strategic group map to visually represent the competitive landscape.
    *   Select two key dimensions and plot the firms in the industry on the map.
    *   Group firms that are located close to each other on the map into strategic groups.
    *   Label the groups appropriately for easier communication.

1.  **Analyze Competitive Dynamics:**
    *   Analyze the competitive dynamics within and between strategic groups.
