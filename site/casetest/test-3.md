Between November 2020 and November 2024, Ford has been actively maneuvering to maintain its position and chart a course for future growth in this dynamic environment.

Despite the intense pressures, Ford has shown resilience and an ability to expand its reach. By 2023, the company's global market share had risen to 6.6%, a notable increase from the 5.8% it held in 2019. This translated to a sales volume of approximately 6.1 million vehicles in 2023, up from around 5.1 million units four years prior. This growth in volume was accompanied by a healthy increase in operating revenues, which climbed from $155.9 billion in 2019 to over $176.1 billion by the end of 2023. Perhaps most significantly, Ford dramatically improved its profitability during this period. After a near break-even year in 2019 with a net income of just $47 million, the company reported a net income of $4.35 billion in 2023, demonstrating a significant turnaround in its financial performance.

However, this period of evolution has been far from straightforward. The years between 2020 and 2024 witnessed dramatic changes in the factors influencing the automotive sector. The initial hopes of a swift pandemic recovery gave way to concerns about inflation and rising interest rates impacting consumer spending. The technological landscape was also in constant flux, with electric vehicles transitioning from a future prospect to a current market reality, bringing both opportunities and new challenges, such as the reliability of emerging battery technologies and the build-out of charging infrastructure.

Adding to the complexity, the competitive arena became even more crowded. Established players faced a growing influx of new electric vehicle manufacturers, particularly from China, intensifying the battle for market share and putting pressure on pricing. Meanwhile, customer preferences continued their march towards larger vehicles like SUVs and trucks, coupled with an increasing openness to electric vehicle options beyond traditional European brands.

To understand where this 100-year-old company is headed next, it is important to understand how its leadership team is making decisions about its global presence and its business portfolio in response to a shifting landscape. Ford faces significant headwinds as it navigates an increasingly competitive global market. The rise of new Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers poses a considerable challenge across the world. Simultaneously, the emerging trend of software-defined vehicles and the competition from nimble startups, unburdened by legacy systems, present a disruptive force.

The coming years will be critical as Ford seeks to adapt and thrive in this evolving automotive era.

**A Century on Wheels: Ford's Journey from Detroit to the World**

The story of Ford Motor Company is deeply intertwined with the very evolution of the automobile and the globalization of industry. Founded in 1903 by Henry Ford, the company quickly revolutionized manufacturing with the introduction of the moving assembly line, making car ownership accessible to the masses with the iconic Model T. This innovation not only transformed personal transportation in America but also laid the groundwork for Ford's early international expansion.

Even in its nascent years, Ford recognized the potential of global markets. By 1911, Ford had established its first overseas assembly plant in Manchester, England, followed swiftly by operations in other key markets like Canada, Germany, and Australia. This early foray beyond domestic borders demonstrated a strategic vision to capitalize on growing demand for automobiles worldwide. The company's initial approach often involved establishing local assembly plants that utilized components shipped from the United States, allowing Ford to cater to local market needs while maintaining economies of scale in core manufacturing.

Throughout the 20th century, Ford continued to expand its global footprint, navigating through periods of economic prosperity, global conflicts, and increasing competition. The company's European operations, in particular, grew to become a significant part of its overall business, with models like the Ford of Britain and Ford-Werke GmbH developing vehicles tailored to the specific tastes and conditions of the European market. This regional adaptation became a hallmark of Ford's global strategy, balancing standardization with the need for local responsiveness.

The latter half of the century saw Ford making strategic acquisitions and forging partnerships to further solidify its global presence and broaden its product portfolio. The acquisition of British luxury carmaker Jaguar and Swedish automaker Volvo in the late 20th century, while eventually divested, reflected Ford's ambition to compete across various segments and tap into different technological and design capabilities. Similarly, partnerships and joint ventures in emerging markets like Asia played a crucial role in Ford's efforts to gain access to rapidly growing automotive markets.

Over its long history, Ford has weathered numerous economic cycles and competitive challenges. From the rise of domestic competitors in the early 20th century to the surge of Japanese automakers in the latter half, Ford has consistently adapted its strategies and operations. The company's journey from a Detroit-based manufacturer to a global automotive powerhouse is a testament to its enduring legacy and its continuous efforts to navigate the ever-changing world of the automobile.

**Challenges and Future Outlook**

As Ford charts its course through the evolving automotive landscape, the company faces a complex array of challenges that will significantly shape its future trajectory. Several key issues stand out, demanding careful strategic consideration and decisive action.

One prominent challenge lies in the **uncertainty surrounding the adoption rate of electric vehicles in the United States**. While demand for EVs is growing, the pace of this growth may not meet the lofty expectations that have been widely anticipated. This uncertainty is further compounded by potential shifts in government policies and incentives under different administrations, which can directly impact consumer demand and the development of crucial charging infrastructure, making long-term planning and execution particularly difficult.

Ford is also confronting a **new breed of competitors who are taking a software and digital-first approach to vehicle design**, unencumbered by the legacy of traditional automobile manufacturing. This group includes Western companies like Tesla and Rivian, which possess a similar cost and governance structure, but also Chinese Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) such as BYD. These Chinese OEMs benefit from an asymmetric cost advantage stemming from a significantly larger domestic EV market (accounting for a much higher percentage of new vehicle sales compared to the US), proximity to established industry clusters like Shenzhen, and supportive government policies. This cost asymmetry poses a significant competitive threat to established players like Ford.

The **combined emergence of mobility services, such as ride-hailing, and the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology present another potential disruption to the traditional OEM business model**. Companies with existing capabilities in these areas, such as Uber and Waymo, possess considerable resources and expertise. Developing in-house capabilities to effectively compete with these players within a reasonable timeframe may prove to be a substantial challenge for Ford.

Beyond these specific issues, Ford continues to operate in a highly competitive global automotive industry, facing pressure from both traditional rivals and new entrants. The company must also navigate a complex and evolving regulatory environment, with increasingly stringent emissions standards and a global push towards electrification. Fluctuations in commodity prices, potential supply chain disruptions, and the need for continuous innovation across its product portfolio add further layers of complexity to Ford's future outlook.

The success of Ford's "Ford+" plan, which aims to leverage its strengths, build new capabilities, and foster customer loyalty, will be crucial in navigating these challenges. The company's strategic focus on its strong truck and SUV franchises, its efforts to streamline operations, and its multi-pronged approach to electrification will all play a vital role in determining its ability to thrive in the years ahead. However, the path forward is fraught with uncertainty, and Ford's leadership will need to demonstrate agility and strategic foresight to successfully navigate the curves in the road ahead.

**Ford's Evolving Structure: Understanding the Business Portfolio**

In response to these evolving industry dynamics and the challenges outlined, Ford has strategically adapted its organizational structure to better position itself for the future. For over a century, Ford Motor Company has been in the business of moving people and goods. Incorporated in 1919, building upon a legacy that began in 1903 with Henry Ford's vision, the company's fundamental purpose remains consistent: to help build a better world where people are free to move and pursue their dreams. However, the way Ford organizes and describes its core business has evolved significantly in recent years, reflecting a strategic transformation aimed at navigating a rapidly changing industry.

Before 2023, Ford structured its operations for reporting purposes around three main segments: Automotive, Mobility, and Ford Credit. The Automotive segment encompassed the traditional activities of developing, manufacturing, distributing, and servicing Ford and Lincoln vehicles. The Mobility segment was focused on exploring and pursuing emerging mobility solutions such as shuttle and bike rental services. Ford Credit provided essential financing and insurance services related to vehicle ownership.

However in 2023, Ford changed its reporting structure, marking a significant evolution in Ford's operating model. This change saw the traditional Automotive segment replaced by three new, customer-centric business units: Ford Blue, Ford Model e, and Ford Pro. Ford Blue took on the responsibility of engineering and manufacturing Ford's traditional internal combustion engined powered and hybrid vehicles for retail customers. Ford Model e was established with a dedicated focus on inventing breakthrough electric vehicles and developing the embedded software to power seamless digital experiences for consumers. Ford Pro was created to serve the unique needs of commercial, government, and rental customers, offering a comprehensive suite of vehicles – including ICE, hybrid, and electric – along with tailored services to help them transform and grow their businesses. The company reported intelligent software based solutions that help commercial customers perform fleet management, telematics, and EV charging management as a primary focus for the business unit. The Mobility segment continued its evolution as Ford Next, while Ford Credit remained a crucial and separate segment.

This reorganization was a direct outcome of the "Ford+ plan for growth and value creation," a strategy that has gained increasing prominence in the company's communications since its introduction before February 2022. Ford+ aims to leverage the company's existing strengths, build new capabilities in critical areas like electrification and connectivity, and foster "always-on" relationships with customers to enhance their experiences and loyalty. The new business segments – Ford Blue, Model e, and Pro – are the vehicles through which Ford intends to deliver on the promises of the Ford+ plan. This structure allows for increased transparency and accountability for each customer-focused segment's contribution to Ford's overall growth and profitability.

The shift in organizational structure has also been reflected in Ford's leadership team and reporting lines. While the company has consistently identified its key leaders, the move to the new customer-centric segments has led to the creation of specific leadership roles, such as Presidents for Ford Blue and Ford Customer Service Division, and a Chief Operating Officer for Ford Model e, indicating a direct focus on these strategic areas. Furthermore, the increasing importance of technology is highlighted by more explicit reporting lines for key technology roles, such as the Chief Software & Information Officer and the Chief Enterprise Technology Officer, who report directly to the CEO.

Ford's management describes the relationship between Ford Blue, Ford Pro, and Ford Model e as one of synergy and strategic alignment. These segments cooperate closely, with Ford Blue leveraging its manufacturing expertise for both traditional and hybrid vehicles, Ford Model e driving innovation in EVs and software, and Ford Pro serving commercial customers with a range of vehicle options and tailored services. This interconnectedness, facilitated by intersegment transactions and shared resources, is strategically designed to execute the Ford+ vision and position Ford for a more focused and profitable future in the evolving automotive landscape.

**Ford's Strategic Responses: Key Business Moves**

Faced with these significant challenges and operating under its evolved structure, Ford has implemented a series of key strategic moves to navigate the evolving automotive industry.

**Strategic Reliance on Partnerships Over Acquisitions:** Ford's management has increasingly leaned towards strategic partnerships and alliances rather than outright acquisitions as a key tool for managing risk, enhancing execution, and achieving cost efficiencies. The high complexity and potential integration challenges often associated with acquisitions, as noted in the company's Form 10-K filings, likely contribute to this preference. A prime example is Ford's global alliance with Volkswagen (VW), which aims to leverage the collective strengths of both companies in areas like light commercial vehicles, medium pickups, electrification, and autonomous driving, allowing for scale gains and cost sharing without the complexities of a full merger. Similarly, Ford's strategic agreement and equity investment in Rivian provided access to a flexible electric vehicle platform, accelerating Ford's entry into the EV market without the need for extensive internal development from scratch. In Europe, the evolving partnership with Ford Otosan, a joint venture in Turkey, has seen Ford Otosan take on a more significant role as a Europe-wide supplier of a broader range of Ford vehicles, demonstrating Ford's reliance on established joint ventures to optimize its regional operations.

**Portfolio and Asset Rationalization: Streamlining for Strength:** A strong element of Ford's managerial playbook involves the continuous rationalization of its portfolio and assets through divestments and market exits. This strategy includes a focus on streamlining the number of vehicle platforms. As early as 2015, Ford announced its decision to reduce its global car and truck platforms from 27 down to just eight to decrease manufacturing complexity and trim production costs. More recent actions, such as the significant plant closure in South America and the restructuring of operations in Europe, including the closure of six manufacturing facilities, highlight Ford's commitment to addressing underperforming parts of the business and focusing on more profitable segments. These moves align with a strategy of concentrating resources on areas where Ford believes it can compete most effectively.

**Navigating the Innovation Dilemma:** Ford's management understands the inherent challenges of balancing the pursuit of breakthrough innovation with the need to remain competitive in existing markets that risk disruption. To navigate this, Ford employs a range of organizational modes. The creation of a "super-talented skunk works team" operating separately from the main organization to develop a low-cost EV platform exemplifies an approach to foster agile and unconventional thinking for potentially disruptive technologies. Strategic investments in startups like Rivian provide exposure to cutting-edge technologies and new business models. Joint ventures, such as BlueOval SK with SK On for battery production, allow Ford to share the significant investment and execution risks associated with developing new technologies and building out supply chains.

**Hedging Bets in the Evolving EV Market:** Recognizing the evolving customer appetite and market dynamics for electric vehicles, Ford has adopted a strategy of hedging its bets across various approaches:

1.  **Developing EV-only brands on its own platforms:** The Mustang Mach-E in the U.S. showcases Ford's commitment to creating distinct EV brands built on internally developed platforms.
2.  **Leveraging partner platforms for EV-only brands:** In Europe, Ford is utilizing Volkswagen's MEB platform to introduce EV-only models like the Explorer EV and Capri, demonstrating a willingness to collaborate to expand its EV offerings and potentially achieve cost efficiencies.
3.  **Offering EVs that share brand and platform elements with existing ICE offerings:** The Ford F-150 Lightning in the U.S. and the Ford Puma Gen-E in the UK represent a strategy of leveraging familiar and popular nameplates while transitioning to electric powertrains, potentially reducing product risk by appealing to existing customer bases.

**Focused Execution Through Staggered Product Launches:** Ford appears to prioritize focused execution by strategically staggering its major new product launches. The company has shown a pattern of introducing significant vehicles, such as the Mustang Mach-E, various iterations of the F-150 (including the Lightning), different Bronco models, and the Maverick, at different times. This deliberate sequencing allows Ford to dedicate the necessary attention and resources to ensure successful execution of each launch, as highlighted by the lessons learned from the all-new Explorer launch in 2019. This approach reflects an understanding by the top management of the need to limit strategic initiatives to prevent spreading resources too thinly, thereby reducing overall execution risk. CEO Jim Hackett's statement about not wanting to add more to the plate before concluding existing commitments further illustrates this principle of focused execution.

This multifaceted approach within Ford's strategic playbook – a reliance on partnerships for shared risk and resources, a disciplined rationalization of its portfolio and platforms, a targeted pursuit of innovation through diverse organizational modes, a carefully hedged entry into the electric vehicle market, and a commitment to focused execution through staggered product launches – collectively points towards a strategy aimed at achieving both economies of scale and scope. By leveraging common platforms across multiple vehicle lines and powertrains, and by collaborating with partners to share development costs and access new technologies, Ford seeks to reduce its overall cost structure. Simultaneously, the focus on strong brands and compelling new products, including a growing array of electric vehicles tailored to different market segments and customer preferences, aims to enhance customer willingness-to-pay, ultimately driving greater value creation for the company in the years to come.

**Ford's Global Footprint: Where Does the Blue Oval Fly?**

For a company that began in the heartland of America, Ford Motor Company has cultivated a significant and complex global presence over its long history. Today, the blue oval can be found in diverse markets around the world, each with its own dynamics and strategic importance to the Dearborn-based automaker. Understanding Ford's operations requires a closer look at the unique conditions within each of these key regions and how they contrast with the dynamics of its home market.

**A Stronghold in North America: Navigating Domestic Dynamics:** Ford's roots remain firmly planted in North America, with its headquarters in Dearborn, Michigan. The company enjoys a particularly strong position in the United States, where its F-Series truck has reigned as the top-selling truck for an impressive 43 years as of 2019, and continued its dominance for 46 years as of 2022. In 2019, Ford held the leadership position in both U.S. full-size pickups and total pickup sales, with the reintroduction of the Ranger capturing a substantial 21% share of the midsize pickup segment in its first full year of domestic production. Ford Credit also maintains a robust business in both the United States and Canada. Notably, North America has become an increasingly vital revenue driver for Ford in recent years, accounting for approximately 71.1% of its total revenue in 2024, up from around 54% in 2017 and 2018. This increasing reliance highlights the importance of understanding the specific market conditions within North America. Demand for automobiles here is closely tied to the overall economic environment, with sustained growth typically boosting sales. Ford benefits from various government incentives at the national, state, and local levels, designed to encourage investment and production. Competition is intense from both traditional automakers and new entrants, particularly in the rapidly evolving electric vehicle market, where pricing pressure has increased. Customer preferences in North America lean towards larger, more profitable vehicles like trucks and SUVs, aligning with Ford's traditional strengths. Ford must also navigate a complex regulatory environment, with evolving safety, emissions, and fuel economy standards, including the increasing focus on vehicle electrification. Labor costs, influenced by collective bargaining agreements, and supply chain stability are also significant factors impacting Ford's operations in its home market.

**A Significant Presence in Europe: Adapting to Stringent Regulations and Focusing on Commercial Strengths:** Europe represents Ford Credit’s largest operational footprint outside of the United States. While Ford has historically maintained a considerable manufacturing presence in Europe, the company has strategically strengthened its leadership in the commercial vehicle sector, holding the #1 vehicle brand position with a 14.3% market share in a recent period. Ford boasts the most extensive network of commercial vehicle dealerships across the continent. This strategic focus on commercial vehicles, where Ford holds a leading position, demonstrates an effort to capitalize on existing strengths in a competitive market. The company has also focused on a more targeted portfolio of passenger vehicles while importing iconic nameplates to cater to European consumers. Ford Credit's European operations are primarily managed through subsidiaries in the UK and Germany, which are its largest markets within the region. While Europe's contribution to Ford's total revenue has fluctuated, it stood at approximately 16.6% in 2024. To streamline operations and address underperforming areas, Ford has undertaken significant restructuring in Europe, including the closure of six manufacturing facilities and a reduction of its workforce. This strategic redesign indicates a move towards fortifying its strengths in the commercial vehicle market and focusing on a more profitable passenger vehicle portfolio. Ford operates in a highly competitive European automotive market. The region faces stringent regulations limiting pollutant emissions, with increasing requirements through Euro 7 standards. The UK's withdrawal from the European Union (Brexit) also introduces potential complexities regarding diverging regulations and trade. Notably, Ford has a significant and evolving partnership with Volkswagen in Europe, involving sourcing agreements, which is crucial for navigating regulatory changes and potentially in the area of electric vehicles. Furthermore, Ford's partnership with Ford Otosan in Turkey has grown in strategic importance, with Ford Otosan becoming the sole supplier of a broader range of vehicles for Europe, further emphasizing Ford's reliance on a strong partner to enhance its European operations.

**Navigating the Asian Market, with a Focus on China and the Changan Partnership:** Ford has established a presence in Asia, including China and Taiwan, primarily operating through unconsolidated affiliates and joint ventures. While its market share in China (including Taiwan) reached 2.1% in 2022, this represents a decrease from earlier years when it aimed for a 6% share by 2015. Indeed, the percentage of Ford's total revenue derived from China has seen a general decline, falling from approximately 4.3% in 2017 to around 1.0% in 2024. This highlights the unique challenges Ford faces in this intensely competitive market, which has seen the rapid growth of domestic electric vehicle manufacturers. Ford's key partnership in China is with Changan Ford Automobile Corporation (CAF), a 50/50 joint venture responsible for producing and distributing Ford and Lincoln vehicles. This long-standing relationship is strategically important for Ford's presence in China, particularly in the electric vehicle sector, where Ford management has acknowledged the strong performance of their JV partner. Ford is actively considering how to leverage this partnership to achieve its EV objectives in a more capital-efficient manner, benefiting from Changan's understanding of the local market. The leadership's engagement with Changan underscores the significance of this relationship for Ford's strategy in China, which is seen not only as a crucial domestic market but also potentially as an export hub. However, the U.S.-China relations and China's unique regulatory landscape present specific risks for Ford's operations in the region.

**Strategic Divestitures and Restructuring Across the Globe:** In parallel with its regional operations and partnership efforts, Ford has also undertaken significant divestitures and restructuring actions globally to streamline its operations and focus on more profitable areas. This has included exiting the heavy truck business in South America and closing manufacturing facilities in Brazil, a move towards an "asset-light business model" centered on the "industry-leading Ranger pickup trucks" and "Transit commercial vehicles," clearly aligning with Ford's strength in these segments. In Europe, beyond the broader restructuring, specific plants in the UK, France, and Germany have been closed or production has ceased for certain models. Ford also restructured its operations in Russia, ultimately selling a controlling interest in its Ford Sollers venture. In India, after the Mahindra joint venture fell through, Ford announced plans to exit engine and vehicle manufacturing operations. These actions demonstrate a decisive approach to addressing underperforming parts of the business and adapting to changing market conditions worldwide.

In examining Ford's global presence and its recent strategic moves, a clear theme emerges: a drive to compete based on its core strengths. The company appears to be strategically aligning its global operations around its established prowess in truck and SUV platforms, exemplified by the enduring success of the F-Series and Ranger in North America, and leveraging the power of its iconic brands like Mustang and Bronco. This is further evident in the increasing revenue contribution from the North American market, where these vehicle segments dominate. Simultaneously, Ford has been rationalizing its footprint in other regions, such as Europe, where it is focusing on its leadership in commercial vehicles, and South America, where the strategy centers on the strength of the Ranger and Transit. Strategic partnerships, particularly overseas with companies like Volkswagen and Ford Otosan, also appear to be aimed at leveraging scale and leadership in areas where Ford has a strong market position. This overarching strategy suggests a deliberate effort to fortify Ford's position by concentrating on its inherent capabilities and well-recognized product lines in the global automotive arena.
