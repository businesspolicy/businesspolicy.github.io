# Case Test
You'll have three case tests in this course. These tests challenge you to analyze real-world business cases and apply the strategic management frameworks we've covered in class.

**Here's the format:**

* **Offline and Open-book:** Bring paper copies of your notes, readings, slides â€“ anything you think might be helpful!
* **No Internet:** You won't be able to use any internet-connected devices during the test.
* **Test Dates:**  February 13th, March 20th, April 8th
* **Test Duration:** 60 minutes per test
* **Unseen Cases:**  The cases will not be provided in advance. You'll see them for the first time during the test.
