Okay, let's start drafting the case. Given the outline and the source material, here's a first pass at the **Introduction:**

**Introduction**

The warehouse club industry provides a compelling example of strategic rivalry and the constant need to adapt to changing consumer preferences. Companies like Costco and Sam's Club have carved out successful niches by offering a unique value proposition: bulk goods at discounted prices to members who pay an annual fee[cite: 3688, 3689, 3690]. This model has proven resilient, attracting value-seeking customers ranging from large families to small businesses[cite: 3656, 3657, 3658, 3659, 3660, 3661, 3662, 3663, 3664, 3665, 3666, 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671].

Costco, with its upscale image and focus on high-quality private-label goods, has traditionally attracted a more affluent customer base[cite: 3663, 3664, 3665, 3666, 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671]. Sam's Club, while also emphasizing value, has historically targeted small-business owners[cite: 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674, 3675, 3676, 3677, 3678, 3679, 3680, 3681, 3682, 3683, 3684, 3685]. However, the competitive landscape is evolving. Sam's Club, in particular, is making strategic shifts to broaden its appeal and better compete with Costco[cite: 3686, 3687, 3688, 3689, 3690, 3691].

One notable trend is the increasing interest of Gen Z consumers in warehouse clubs[cite: 3692, 3693, 3694, 3695, 3696]. These younger shoppers, known for their savvy approach to spending and their willingness to embrace new shopping habits, represent a significant growth opportunity for warehouse retailers[cite: 3697, 3698, 3699, 3700, 3701, 3702, 3703, 3704, 3705, 3706, 3707, 3708, 3709, 3710, 3711, 3712, 3713, 3714, 3715].

This case will examine the strategic challenges and opportunities facing Sam's Club as it seeks to strengthen its competitive position and capitalize on emerging trends in the warehouse club industry, specifically the rise of Gen Z[cite: 4040, 4041, 4042, 4043, 4044, 4045, 4046, 4047, 4048, 4049, 4050, 4051, 4052, 4053, 4054, 4055].

Alright, let's continue drafting the case, focusing on Section 2, **The Warehouse Club Customer**. We need to create a rich picture of the customer, their shopping habits, needs, and willingness-to-pay factors. We should also set the stage for students to apply experience mapping, customer journey mapping, and jobs-to-be-done frameworks.

Here's a draft:

**2. The Warehouse Club Customer**

For decades, warehouse clubs have attracted a loyal customer base seeking value and bulk purchasing options[cite: 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674]. These customers are willing to pay an annual membership fee to access a wide array of products, from groceries and household essentials to electronics and apparel, all offered in large quantities and at discounted prices[cite: 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674].

Traditionally, the warehouse club customer has often been characterized by larger households looking to stock up on everyday items, small business owners seeking supplies, or savvy shoppers aiming to maximize their purchasing power[cite: 3674, 3675, 3676, 3677, 3678, 3679, 3680]. These customers often prioritize value, convenience, and the ability to purchase in bulk to save money and reduce the frequency of shopping trips[cite: 3674, 3675, 3676, 3677, 3678, 3679, 3680].

To truly understand the warehouse club customer, it's essential to delve deeper into their needs and motivations. Consider a typical week for a Sam's Club member:

* **Weekend:** The customer might plan their shopping trip, reviewing the club's offerings online or in-app and creating a shopping list[cite: 377, 393, 394, 395].
* **Mid-week:** They might make a trip to the club, navigating the large format and potentially long checkout lines, but also taking advantage of the in-store experience, which could include food samples or browsing "treasure hunt" items[cite: 364, 365].
* **Throughout the week:** The customer utilizes the bulk purchases they've made, whether it's feeding their family, stocking their business, or simply enjoying the convenience of having essential items on hand.

Several factors contribute to the willingness to pay for a warehouse club membership:

* **Value Perception:** Customers believe they are getting a good deal on the products they purchase, often due to lower per-unit prices compared to traditional retail[cite: 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674].
* **Bulk Savings:** The ability to buy in bulk reduces the need for frequent shopping trips and ensures they have essential items available[cite: 3674, 3675, 3676, 3677, 3678, 3679, 3680].
* **Product Variety:** Warehouse clubs offer a wide selection of items, including groceries, electronics, and household goods, catering to diverse needs[cite: 3680, 3681, 3682, 3683, 3684, 3685, 3686, 3687, 3688, 3689, 3690, 3691].
* **Exclusivity:** Membership provides access to products and deals not available to the general public[cite: 3667, 3668, 3669, 3670, 3671, 3672, 3673, 3674].

Okay, I understand. You want to enrich Section 3 with more details about the business activities, motivations, and outcomes for Costco and Sam's Club.

Based on the source documents, here's an expanded draft of Section 3:

**3. Costco and Sam's Club: A Rivalry Analysis**

Costco and Sam's Club, while both operating in the warehouse club industry, have distinct competitive strategies and focus on different customer needs. This rivalry is characterized by ongoing investments and strategic maneuvers aimed at gaining and sustaining competitive advantage.

**Costco**

Costco has positioned itself as a warehouse club with an upscale image, focusing on a more affluent customer base[cite: 363, 63, 64]. Key aspects of Costco's strategy include:

* **Private Label Excellence:** Costco is known for its high-quality private-label brand, Kirkland Signature, which accounts for a substantial portion of its sales[cite: 363, 64]. This emphasis on private labels allows Costco to offer unique products and build customer loyalty.
   
* **Treasure Hunt Experience:** Costco utilizes "treasure-hunt" items, which are limited-time offerings designed to encourage impulse buys and increase store traffic[cite: 365, 65]. This strategy creates excitement and a sense of discovery for shoppers.
   
* **Product Selection:** Costco differentiates itself by offering a wider selection of organic and "alternative" food choices, as well as an upscale selection of beer and wine[cite: 363, 86]. This caters to customers seeking higher-quality and specialty products.
   
* **Membership Value:** Costco focuses on providing value to its members through a combination of quality products, low prices, and a positive shopping experience.
   
Costco's strategies have resulted in strong customer loyalty and a dominant position in the warehouse club industry[cite: 363, 64, 65].

**Sam's Club**

Sam's Club, owned by Walmart, has historically targeted small-business owners with a low-price, no-frills strategy[cite: 368]. However, it is now also focusing on attracting families with annual incomes between \$75,000 and \$125,000[cite: 368]. Key aspects of Sam's Club's strategy include:

* **Low-Price Focus:** Sam's Club emphasizes its position as a low-cost provider, appealing to value-seeking customers[cite: 368, 69, 71, 72].
   
* **Technology Adoption:** Sam's Club is investing heavily in technology to improve the customer experience and streamline operations[cite: 378, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91]. This includes initiatives such as:
   * Expanding its Scan & Go app to expedite checkout[cite: 378, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91].
   * Testing new features like Scan & Ship to allow customers to scan purchases and have items shipped home[cite: 378, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 3927, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 940, 41, 42, 43].
   * Investing in automation for its supply chain and distribution centers to improve efficiency and speed up fulfillment[cite: 4177, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 4100, 181].
   
* **Store Format and Location:** Sam's Club is strategically closing underperforming stores and opening new ones in high-growth suburban areas to better serve its target demographic[cite: 3511, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 554, 55, 6, 67, 18, 554, 55, 6, 67].
   
* **Private Label Development:** Sam's Club is making efforts to improve its private label (Member's Mark) to better compete with Costco's Kirkland Signature[cite: 360, 4042, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81].
   
Sam's Club's strategies aim to enhance its appeal to target customers and improve its competitive position in the warehouse club market[cite: 3511, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 554, 55, 6, 67, 18, 554, 55, 6, 67].

**Outcomes and Competitive Advantages**

* **Customer Perception:** Costco has cultivated an image of quality and value, attracting a loyal customer base willing to pay a premium for its offerings[cite: 363, 64, 65, 86]. Sam's Club is focused on providing value through competitive pricing and convenience[cite: 368, 69, 71, 72].
   
* **Technology and Innovation:** Sam's Club is leveraging technology to enhance the customer experience and improve operational efficiency[cite: 378, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 4177, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 4100, 181]. Costco is also using technology, but it seems to be more focused on using it to improve their supply chain and the shopping experience within the store[cite: 348, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81].
   
* **Private Label Performance:** Both companies recognize the importance of private labels in driving membership and sales[cite: 363, 64, 65, 86, 4036, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81]. Costco's Kirkland Signature has been highly successful, driving membership sign-ups and renewals[cite: 4050, 51]. Sam's Club is investing in Member's Mark to improve its quality and appeal to members[cite: 360, 4042, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81].
   
* **Competition and Growth:** Both Costco and Sam's Club are expanding their store presence, indicating confidence in the continued growth of the warehouse club industry[cite: 3854, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 3903, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 3903, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17]. Sam's Club is focusing on expanding in high-growth suburban areas and enhancing its e-commerce capabilities[cite: 3511, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 554, 55, 6, 67, 18, 554, 55, 6, 67, 4177, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 4100, 181].
   

Okay, let's proceed with drafting Section 4, "The Gen Z Opportunity."

Based on the source documents, here's a draft focusing on the characteristics and shopping preferences of Gen Z consumers and the potential of this segment for warehouse clubs:

**4. The Gen Z Opportunity**

Gen Z, generally defined as those born between the late 1990s and the early 2010s, represents a consumer segment with distinct characteristics and shopping preferences. [cite: 3686, 3687] As digital natives, they are comfortable with technology and expect seamless online and mobile experiences. [cite: 3686, 375, 78, 8, 82] They are also known for being value-conscious, seeking affordability and quality in their purchases. [cite: 375, 78, 8, 82]

Interestingly, Gen Z shoppers are increasingly showing interest in warehouse clubs like Sam's Club and Costco. [cite: 375, 78, 8, 82] This trend presents a significant opportunity for these retailers. [cite: 372]

Several factors contribute to this growing interest:

* **Value Proposition:** Warehouse clubs align with Gen Z's value-conscious mindset by offering bulk goods at discounted prices. [cite: 372, 62, 71] This allows them to save money, which is a key priority for this generation. [cite: 372, 62, 71]
   
* **Social Shopping:** Gen Z often enjoys shopping as a social activity. [cite: 370, 71] The experience of shopping at a warehouse club, with its vast selection and "treasure hunt" atmosphere, can be appealing to them. [cite: 363, 64, 65]
   
* **Bulk Buying and Sharing:** Gen Z consumers, particularly those living with roommates or in shared housing, find bulk buying attractive as it allows them to split costs and reduce the frequency of shopping trips. [cite: 75, 76, 77, 79, 82]

Sam's Club, in particular, has recognized the importance of this demographic, with Gen Z representing the fastest-growing member group. [cite: 75, 78, 8, 82] Memberships for shoppers ages 27 and under have risen significantly in recent years, and Gen Z and millennial shoppers now make up a quarter of Sam's Club members. [cite: 75, 78, 8, 82]

This growing interest from Gen Z presents a valuable opportunity for Sam's Club to expand its customer base and drive future growth. [cite: 372, 62, 71] By understanding and catering to the specific needs and preferences of this demographic, Sam's Club can strengthen its competitive position and ensure long-term success.

Got it, let's continue building the case. Here's a draft for Section 5, "Sam's Club's Strategic Challenge," including a potential decision prompt for the students:

**5. Sam's Club's Strategic Challenge**

Sam's Club has made significant strides in recent years to enhance its competitiveness, focusing on technology adoption, supply chain improvements, and a refined target customer. The increasing interest from Gen Z consumers presents both an opportunity and a challenge for the company.

On one hand, this demographic aligns well with the value proposition of warehouse clubs, seeking affordability and bulk savings. Sam's Club has already seen success in attracting Gen Z members, indicating a potential for growth in this segment.

However, Gen Z also has distinct preferences and expectations. To fully capitalize on this opportunity, Sam's Club must carefully consider how to adapt its existing strategies and capabilities to meet the needs of Gen Z while sustaining its advantages with its traditional customer base.

The company's current competitive advantages, such as its focus on low prices, technology adoption, and investments in the supply chain, may or may not fully resonate with Gen Z. For example, while Gen Z appreciates value, they may also prioritize convenience, digital integration, and unique experiences.

**Decision Prompt:**

* "As a senior manager at Sam's Club, develop a strategic plan to capture the Gen Z market while sustaining the company’s existing competitive advantages. Your plan should address the following:"
    * "Evaluate Sam's Club's current competitive advantages and their sustainability."
    * "Analyze Sam's Club's value chain activities and how they create value for current customers."
    * "Assess the transferability of these advantages to the Gen Z segment."
    * "Identify opportunities to create, improve, and sustain competitive advantage with Gen Z."

Okay, let's draft the next section, Section 6, which will not be provided to the students. It is meant to guide the students in their analysis and recommendations.

**6. Analysis and Recommendations (Guidelines for Students)**

In this section, students should apply the concepts and frameworks from the course to analyze Sam's Club's strategic challenge and develop recommendations. Here's a suggested structure:

* **Current Competitive Advantages:**
   * Students should identify Sam's Club's current competitive advantages, drawing from the case facts and their understanding of the warehouse club industry.
   * They should evaluate the sustainability of these advantages, considering factors such as imitability, durability, and the potential for erosion by competitors.
   * Reference the concepts from the readings such as "Sources of Sustainability" from the file titled "sustaining_competitive_advantage.pdf"
* **Value Chain Analysis:**
   * Students should analyze Sam's Club's key value chain activities (e.g., procurement, logistics, marketing, technology).
   * They should explain how these activities contribute to creating value for Sam's Club's current customer base.
* **Transferability to Gen Z:**
   * Students should assess the extent to which Sam's Club's existing competitive advantages and value chain activities can be leveraged to serve the Gen Z segment.
   * They should consider the similarities and differences between Gen Z and Sam's Club's traditional customer base.
* **Opportunities for Competitive Advantage with Gen Z:**
   * Students should identify opportunities for Sam's Club to create, improve, and sustain competitive advantage with respect to the Gen Z segment.
   * This could include:
        * Modifying existing activities
        * Adding new activities
        * Leveraging technology
        * Building new capabilities
   * Recommendations should be specific, actionable, and aligned with Sam's Club's overall strategic goals.

This guidance should help students structure their analysis and develop well-supported recommendations for Sam's Club's Gen Z strategy.

Okay, let's draft the next section, Section 7, "Exhibits." This section will include supplementary information that supports the case but may be too detailed or technical to include in the main body.

Based on the source documents, here's a draft of potential exhibits:

**7. Exhibits**
