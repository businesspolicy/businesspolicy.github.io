In a flipped classroom, in-class time is dedicated to active learning and application of concepts, while lectures and content delivery happen outside of class. Here's an example lesson plan for a flipped Strategic Management course:

**Topic:** Competitive Advantage

**Pre-Class Activities:**

* Students read assigned chapter on competitive advantage.
* Students watch a short video lecture explaining Porter's Five Forces framework.
* Students complete a short online quiz to assess understanding of key concepts.

**In-Class Activities:**

1. **Warm-up (5 minutes):**  Quick review of key terms and concepts via a Kahoot! quiz or a think-pair-share activity.
2. **Case Study Analysis (20 minutes):**  Small groups analyze a case study of a company facing competitive challenges, applying Porter's Five Forces to identify the root causes.
3. **Interactive Discussion (20 minutes):**  Whole-class discussion of the case study, with each group presenting their analysis and recommendations.
4. **Application Exercise (20 minutes):**  Students individually analyze the competitive landscape of a company of their choice, using a provided template.
5. **Wrap-up and Reflection (5 minutes):**  Key takeaways, assignment reminders, and a brief individual reflection on how the session deepened their understanding.

**Post-Class Activities:**

* Students complete an online discussion forum, responding to prompts related to the case study and application exercise.
* Students begin preparing for the next session by reading assigned materials and watching video lectures.

This flipped approach maximizes in-class time for active learning, collaboration, and application of concepts, leading to deeper understanding and engagement.

## Introduction to strategy
1. integrated set of choices
2. An approach to overcome five forces
3. VRIO resources and capabilities 
4. Blue Ocean strategy
5. Emergent Strategy
    a. app store rejection by steve jobs
    b. Intel memory chip to CPU transition 
6. Bounded Rationality 
7. Garbage Can Model

Is business model and strategy the same?
business model ~ generic strategy => WTP - SOP => technology + structure  + culture 
what if internal demographic, cultural, gender etc etc diversity is not reflective of the market the company serves? 
culture is stabilizing ~ how do we bring about change then => structure aka corporate strategy shotgun marriages
why firms exist and fit 

where should we compete and how
advantage through economies of scale and scope

four approaches to strategy and strategic management
blue ocean, RBV, and five forces are complmentary
emergent strategy not a framework - emphasizes balancing planning and learning
business model: internal fit, external fit, tradeoff => consistent set of choices

This structure is excellent for a flipped classroom! It provides a balance of instructor guidance, active recall, application, and higher-order analysis. Here's how it aligns with the learning objectives of a typical Strategic Management course:

**Alignment with Learning Objectives**

* **Lesson Introduction:**
    * Provides context and sets the stage for deeper learning.
    * Aligns with objectives related to understanding the "big picture" of strategy and its relevance. [cite: 18, 19]

* **Recall Activity:**
    * Reinforces key concepts and terminology from pre-class readings/videos.
    * Aligns with objectives related to knowledge acquisition and comprehension. [cite: 423, 424, 425, 426, 427, 428, 429, 430, 514, 515, 516, 517, 518, 519, 520]

* **Simple Application Activity:**
    * Bridges the gap between theory and practice.
    * Aligns with objectives related to applying frameworks and concepts to real-world scenarios. [cite: 19, 269, 270, 271, 272]

* **Complex Analytical Activity:**
    * Develops higher-order thinking skills (analysis, evaluation, problem-solving).
    * Aligns with objectives related to strategic decision-making, case analysis, and developing recommendations. [cite: 197, 198, 250, 251, 252, 253]

* **Conclusion and Wrap-up:**
    * Reinforces key takeaways and provides continuity.
    * Aligns with objectives related to synthesizing information and preparing for future learning.

**Enhancements and Considerations**

* **Variety:** Incorporate a variety of activities within each step to cater to diverse learning styles (e.g., debates, simulations, role-playing).
* **Technology Integration:**  Leverage technology to enhance engagement and collaboration (e.g., online polls, collaborative documents, virtual whiteboards).
* **Assessment:**  Integrate formative assessment throughout the lesson to gauge understanding and adjust instruction as needed (e.g., quick quizzes, exit tickets, short reflective writing prompts).
* **Flexibility:**  Be prepared to adjust the lesson plan based on student needs and the pace of learning.

By following this structure and incorporating these enhancements, you can create engaging and effective flipped classroom lessons that achieve the learning objectives of your Strategic Management course.



I think the chat configuration is a paid option. I have a paid service called Google AI premium and It includes a bundle of premium features. I just discovered that the chat configuration is part of the AI Premium. I think it will make it to the free tier when competition heats up a bit.
Notes are the not-so-intuitive part. It's hard to convey its usefulness at this stage. Let's put some miles on the product and return to this conversation again.Â 

I'll talk to you again about the pdf soon, Let me check some documentation on that.
Thank you for your feedback :)

Check out this description I've posted on the tutorial. https://businesspolicy.github.io/tutorials/notebooklm-guide/insights/#a-research-workflow-with-notes 

It is a good place to start but requires some experimentation.
