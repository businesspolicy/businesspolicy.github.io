# Getting Started
{:no_toc}

To get started with NotebookLM, you will need to **create a notebook** by uploading your sources. You can upload sources in various formats, including Google Docs, Slides, PDFs, web URLs, copied text, and YouTube URLs. Once you have uploaded your sources, NotebookLM will automatically generate a summary of all your sources. 

Here is a detailed instruction on how to create a notebook:

1.  **On your computer, open NotebookLM.**
2.  **Click on *+ Add Source* in the left panel.**
3.  **Choose the sources that you want to upload for your notebook.**
4.  **Click *Insert*.**

Now, you can start collaborating with NotebookLM by doing the following:

*   **View the automatically generated summary of all your sources in the center of the screen.**
*   **Ask questions about your sources by typing at the bottom of the screen.**
*   **Use the Studio panel on the right to create outputs grounded in your sources:**

    *   **Create an audio overview.**
    *   **Create an FAQ, study guide, table of contents, timeline, or briefing document.**
    *   **Add notes to your notebook.**

You can also add or delete sources in your notebook. NotebookLM organizes projects similar to how folders organize files on a computer. Each notebook is separate, so NotebookLM cannot access information from multiple notebooks at the same time.
