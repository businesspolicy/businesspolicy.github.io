# Lesson Plan
{:no_toc}

Okay, I'm channeling my inner Strategic Management student again!  Here's my take on your "NotebookLM Lab" plan, along with a checklist to make sure it hits all the marks:

**Learning Objectives Check:**

Your objectives to get us started with NotebookLM, chatting with sources, working with notes, and creating summaries are spot-on.  But, since the goal is independent company research, I think we need one more:

* **Applying to Company Research:**  Show us how to use NotebookLM specifically for the kind of company analysis we'll be doing in this course.  Maybe a mini-example using a real company's 10-K report or earnings call transcript?

**Checklist for an Awesome Lab:**

**Getting Started:**

* **Access:** Clear instructions on how to access NotebookLM (including waitlist signup if needed).
* **New Notebook:** Step-by-step guide on creating a new notebook.
* **Device/Browser Compatibility:** Address any known issues or limitations across different devices and browsers (Macbooks, iPads, Chromebooks, etc.).
* **Troubleshooting:** Basic troubleshooting tips (e.g., what to do if it's slow, can't access a feature, etc.).

**Chatting with Sources:**

* **Adding Sources:** Different ways to add sources (links, uploads, Google Docs).
* **Asking Questions:**  Examples of good questions to ask, including those relevant to company analysis (e.g., "What are the company's key revenue segments?", "What are the risks outlined in their 10-K?").
* **Chat Interface:**  Tips on using the chat interface effectively (follow-up questions, refining prompts).

**Working with Sources & Notes:**

* **Organizing Sources:**  How to organize sources within a notebook (sections, labels).
* **Taking Notes:**  How to create and save notes from the chat or from scratch.
* **Connecting Notes & Sources:**  Linking notes to specific sections in source documents.

**Creating Summaries:**

* **Summary Types:**  Walkthrough of different summary formats (study guide, bullet points, etc.).
* **Customization:**  How to customize summaries (length, style, focus).
* **Exporting:**  How to export summaries in different formats.

**Applying to Company Research:**

* **Example:** A mini case study showing how to use NotebookLM for a specific company research task (e.g., summarizing key financials from a 10-K, identifying risks from an earnings call).
* **Tips:**  Specific tips for using NotebookLM in the context of our company analysis projects.


**Format & Delivery:**

* **Clear visuals:** Screenshots or screen recordings to illustrate each step.
* **Concise language:**  Easy-to-understand language with minimal jargon.
* **Searchable:**  Make it easy to find specific instructions later on (headings, table of contents).
* **Reference guide:**  Provide a downloadable version (PDF or link to a Google Doc) for easy reference.
