A **note in NotebookLM is a space for you to store information generated by the model, as well as manually inputted text**. Notes are a way for you to **organize key insights and track your thinking** as you interact with the sources you've uploaded to a notebook.  

Notes are useful for several reasons. You can use them to:

*   **Save important findings or responses generated by NotebookLM**. This can help you to keep track of your research and easily refer back to important information later.
*   **Develop your own thoughts and ideas about the source material**. You can use notes to brainstorm, outline arguments, or jot down questions for further investigation.
*   **Create a summary of your sources in a specific format**. NotebookLM offers four preset note formats: briefing doc, timeline, FAQ, and study guide.

**Notes differ from sources in several key ways**. 

*   **Sources are static copies of the original documents** you upload to NotebookLM. Sources can include Google Docs, PDFs, web pages, and other formats.
*   **Notes are dynamic and can be edited, added to, or deleted**. You can create notes by saving model responses, writing new notes, or using the preset summary formats.  

You can think of notes as **manually created summaries of your sources or as new pieces of information that complement your sources**. Both descriptions are accurate. 

*   When you save a model response as a note, you are essentially creating a summary of the information that NotebookLM has extracted from your sources. 
*   When you write your own notes, you are adding new information to the notebook that is not present in the original source documents. 

For example, you might use notes to:

*   Record your own interpretations of the source material
*   Connect ideas from different sources
*   Generate new research questions

In this sense, notes can be seen as a way to **build upon the information contained in your sources and create a more comprehensive understanding of the topic you are researching**.
