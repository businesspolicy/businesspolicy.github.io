# **Industry Analysis**


This is the first major phase of your company analysis project, where you'll continue working with the company your group chose. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Define the Industry:**
    * Clearly identify the relevant industry for each of your company's strategic business units (SBUs).
    * If your company has multiple SBUs, focus on the "cash cows" and "stars" that generate the most revenue.

2. **Strategic Group Analysis:**
    * Categorize competitors based on similarities in their strategies and business models. 

3. **Five Forces Analysis:**
    * Analyze the industry's current attractiveness using Porter's Five Forces framework.
    * Consider whether different strategic groups experience the five forces differently.
    * Please refer back to the industry analysis reading for a detailed example and walk-through.

4. **PESTLE Analysis:**
    * Use the PESTLE framework to assess the industry's future attractiveness.
    * Discuss how your PESTLE findings might impact the strategic groups you identified.
