**Corporate Strategy Analysis Project**

This assignment focuses on understanding your company's corporate strategy and how it creates value. Here's what you'll analyze:

1. **Corporate Portfolio:**
   * Describe your company's corporate portfolio, including all organizational units operating in distinct product and geographic markets.
   * Apply the "better-off," "ownership," and "organizational" tests (explained in the assigned corporate strategy reading) to explain why these units belong together.
   * Compare your company's portfolio with its competitors, providing a critical commentary on the differences and similarities.

2. **Impact on Competitive Advantage:**
   * Revisit the "willingness-to-pay" (WTP) and "supplier-opportunity-cost" (SOC) drivers you identified in the previous competitive advantage analysis.
   * Analyze the net effect of your company's portfolio on these WTP and SOC drivers.

3. **Historical Analysis:**
    * Identify 3-5 landmark corporate events in the company's recent history.
    * Focus on events such as acquisitions, divestments, spin-offs, mergers, alliances, and new geographic and product market entries and exits. 
    * Critically evaluate the rationale and performance review that management offered to investors and analysts for these events.

4. **Organizational Structure:**
    * Analyze your company's organizational structure choices (centralization, decentralization, shared services, etc.) and how they connect the business units.
    * Explain how these choices affect the WTP and SOC drivers.
