# **Dry Run Project: Exploring NotebookLM**

AI tools like NotebookLM can be a game-changer for learning and completing projects like our company analysis. Think of it as your research superpower! NotebookLM can help you:

* **Answer tough questions:** It searches across different sources like YouTube interviews, earnings calls, and even those dense regulatory filings (like DEF 14-A) to find what you need.
* **Make learning easier:**  It summarizes complex documents like 10-K reports in a way that's actually understandable.

This assignment helps you get comfortable with NotebookLM before diving into the main project. Here's what you need to do:

1. **Create a Notebook:** Add relevant sections from the syllabus as sources, using a variety of formats:
    * Links
    * Empty notes (start from scratch)
    * Google Docs
    * Uploaded PDFs
2. **Question Time:**  Imagine you're a student learning about this course for the first time. What questions would you ask? Use the chat interface to get answers.
3. **Save & Organize:** Save helpful responses as notes and organize them into categories that make sense.
4. **Summary Power:** Explore different summary formats:
    * Study guide
    * Audio overview
    * FAQ
5. **Experiment!** See how you can change the structure and content of the summaries.
