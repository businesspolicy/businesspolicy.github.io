# **Strategic Initiative Development Project**

This final assignment challenges you to identify a strategic business problem and propose a solution. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Problem Identification:**
    * Review your previous analyses (industry structure, business strategy, corporate strategy) to identify strategic problems at the industry, business unit, and corporate levels.
    *  For each problem, describe a high-level solution.

2. **Prioritization:**
    *  Develop a logical approach to prioritize the problems and solutions, considering:
        *  Organizational culture
        *  Management style of the CEO and top management team
        *  Investor expectations

3. **Solution Development:**
    * Select the highest-priority problem-solution pair and develop the solution further using the congruence model (explained in the "Executing Strategy" reading).

4. **Presentation & Report:**
    * Create a 10-15 minute video presentation to present your work to the CEO, with the goal of securing their support (financial, human capital, and political) for your initiative.  (Avoid including basic company history or facts.) 
    * Use your AI assistant to role-play as an audience member to ensure your presentation is complete and clear.
    * Supplement your presentation with a 5-page written report that:
        * Provides details about the problems and solutions.
        * Explains your prioritization approach.
        *  Details your strategic initiative development process.
        *  Includes an appendix (no page limit) with supporting tables and exhibits as a separate document.

**Research & Tools:**

* **NotebookLM:** Conduct your analysis using NotebookLM, populating your notebook with relevant source materials.  Share a read-only link to your notebook with me.
* **Authoritative Sources:** Stick to credible sources like:
    * Company 10-K and DEF 14-A reports
    * Earnings call transcripts
