Okay, I'll put on my student hat! Here's what I'd be hoping to hear about in the first session of a Strategic Management course, keeping in mind that we're mostly seniors (and some juniors) in business school:

**1. Big-Picture Context:**

* **What REALLY is strategic management?**  Go beyond the textbook definition. How does it actually play out in companies?  Give us some cool examples of successful (and failed) strategies.
* **Why should we care?**  Connect this to our career goals. How will this course make us better interns, job candidates, or future managers?
* **Debunk the myths:** Is strategy only for top executives?  Is it all about long, boring plans that never get used?

**2. Course Roadmap & Expectations:**

* **Key topics:**  Give us a clear overview of what we'll learn.  Highlight the most interesting and relevant parts.
* **Assignments:**  Break down the major assignments. What are the expectations? How can we excel? (Sharing that awesome rubric you created would be great!)
* **Grading:**  Be upfront about how we'll be assessed.  What are the "must-dos" to succeed in this course?

**3.  Interactive Stuff:**

* **Icebreaker:**  Something quick and fun to get to know you and our classmates.  Maybe a poll about our career interests or a strategic challenge related to a trending company.
* **Discussion:**  A short discussion about a recent business news story that ties into strategy.  This would get us thinking strategically from day one.

**4.  Tools & Resources:**

* **NotebookLM:**  Since we'll be using it all semester, a quick demo would be super helpful.  Show us some cool features and how it can help us with our projects.
* **Other resources:**  Are there any websites, books, or articles you recommend beyond the assigned readings?


Basically, we want to leave the first session feeling excited about the course, clear on what's expected, and confident that we'll gain valuable skills.
