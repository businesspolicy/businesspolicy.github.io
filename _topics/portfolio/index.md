### **Module Introduction: Global and Corporate Strategy**

This module delves into the critical aspects of global and corporate strategy, providing you with frameworks and insights to navigate the complexities of international business and multi-business organizations. Throughout the module, you will learn how firms create and capture value across borders and industries, and how to develop effective strategies in a dynamic global landscape.

Here's a brief overview of each session:

[**International Business Strategy:**](/topics/portfolio/global) This session explores the fundamental reasons why organizations expand internationally, the challenges they face in new national markets, and various strategies they can employ to create and capture value globally. We will discuss different approaches to global value creation, including deployment, development, and deepening strategies. Furthermore, we will examine key decisions such as which activities to locate where and when to enter new geographic markets to maximize value.

[**Corporate Strategy:**](/topics/portfolio/corporate) This session focuses on the strategies employed by firms that operate in multiple business units or industries. We will examine how corporate strategy contributes to overall firm value by improving the competitiveness of individual business units. The session will cover essential concepts such as synergy, ownership, and organization, and introduce frameworks like the "better-off test" to evaluate strategic decisions. We will also discuss different modes of exchange, including spot market transactions and long-term contracts, and their implications for value creation.

[**Portfolio Strategy:**](/topics/portfolio/portfolio) This session integrates the insights from international business and corporate strategy to understand competition in environments where firms compete across multiple geographic markets and industries. We will analyze how firms can leverage their corporate-level resources and capabilities to gain a competitive advantage in a globalized world. This session will likely draw upon concepts discussed in both the "Competing Globally" and "Corporate Strategy" readings to provide a holistic view of operating across multiple product and geographic markets.

**Corporate and Global Strategy Analysis of Your Company:** In this final session, you will apply the frameworks and concepts learned throughout the module to your semester-long company analysis project. This session will provide guidance on how to use international business and corporate strategy tools to analyze a specific company, identify its strategic challenges and opportunities, and propose a strategic initiative.
