**Explanation:** The _60 Minutes_ video highlights Southwest's point-to-point service model as a key factor in its cost advantage. This model avoids the complexities and expenses associated with hub-and-spoke systems used by larger airlines, enabling Southwest to offer lower fares. This aligns with the concept of **achieving a cost advantage** discussed in the notes. The notes highlight how firms that successfully achieve a cost advantage can lower their Supplier Opportunity Cost (SOC) and create a wider wedge between SOC and Willingness to Pay (WTP), ultimately increasing profitability.

*   A.  Threat of new entrants
*   B.  **Bargaining power of suppliers**

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** Southwest's decision to use a single type of aircraft, the Boeing 737, significantly reduces its reliance on multiple suppliers and strengthens its negotiating position. The notes highlight how a firm with strong bargaining power relative to its suppliers can capture a larger share of the value created.  This strategic choice helps Southwest mitigate the **bargaining power of suppliers** by minimizing its dependence on any single supplier and potentially securing more favorable terms.

The notes describe the **Resource-Based View (RBV)** as an approach that focuses on a company's internal resources and capabilities as key drivers of a successful strategy. Southwest's strong culture, nurtured through practices like careful hiring, profit-sharing, and Herb Kelleher's leadership style, can be viewed as a valuable and difficult-to-imitate resource that contributes to the company's competitive advantage.

*   D.  **Emergent Strategy**

**Answer:** D

**Explanation:** The video showcases Herb Kelleher’s unconventional leadership style, suggesting a less rigid, more adaptable approach to management.

Kelleher's actions suggest a willingness to respond to unexpected situations and prioritize employee morale and engagement, characteristics often associated with emergent strategy. 


Here are 5 pub trivia-style questions that connect important concepts from Porter's Five Forces framework to facts from the *60 Minutes* interview about Southwest Airlines:

*   A.  Threat of New Entrants
*   B.  **Bargaining Power of Suppliers**
*   C.  Bargaining Power of Buyers
*   D.  Threat of Substitute Products or Services

**Answer:**  B

**Explanation:** By using only one type of aircraft, Southwest limits its reliance on multiple suppliers, giving it greater negotiating power and potentially lowering costs.  The notes emphasize that **strong bargaining power relative to suppliers allows a firm to capture a larger portion of the value created**. This strategic choice helps to decrease Southwest's dependence on any single supplier, enabling them to potentially secure more favorable pricing and terms. 

**Question 2:**

*   A.  Bargaining Power of Suppliers
*   B.  Bargaining Power of Buyers
*   C.  **Threat of Substitute Products or Services**
*   D.  Intensity of Rivalry among Existing Competitors

**Answer:**  C

**Explanation:** The video highlights Southwest's strategy of competing with ground transportation, like driving, rather than other airlines. By offering low fares on frequent flights between nearby cities, Southwest directly targets customers who might otherwise choose to drive. This strategy effectively reduces the **threat of substitute products or services** by making air travel a more attractive alternative to driving.

*   A.  Threat of New Entrants
*   B.  **Intensity of Rivalry among Existing Competitors**
*   C.  Threat of Substitute Products or Services
*   D.  Bargaining Power of Buyers

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:**  The video details the intense competition between Southwest and America West, highlighting price wars and aggressive advertising campaigns. This rivalry exemplifies the **intensity of rivalry among existing competitors**, a key force in Porter's framework. The intensity of this rivalry underscores the challenges and potential for profit erosion when new entrants seek to compete in an established market.

*   C.  Threat of New Entrants 
*   D.  Intensity of Rivalry among Existing Competitors

**Answer:** B

**Explanation:** The video notes that Southwest does not offer interlining services or connections with other airlines. While this choice streamlines operations and contributes to its cost advantage, it also potentially limits customer options. This restriction could give passengers less bargaining power when choosing an airline, as they have fewer alternatives if they require connecting flights or baggage transfers. This strategy, therefore, can impact the **bargaining power of buyers** by reducing their ability to leverage multiple airline options for a single journey.

*   A.  Threat of New Entrants

*   C.  **Bargaining Power of Buyers**
*   D.  Intensity of Rivalry among Existing Competitors 

**Answer:** C

**Explanation:** The video emphasizes Southwest's commitment to low fares, even resisting shareholder pressure to increase prices.
