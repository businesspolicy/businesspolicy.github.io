## Introduction to Strategy

Welcome to strategic management! In this lesson, we'll start our journey to understand how organizations achieve their goals, navigate complex challenges, and thrive in a dynamic business environment.

### Why Strategy Matters

Strategy is the art and science of making decisions that shape an organization's future. It's about understanding the business landscape, identifying opportunities, and making choices that align with an organization's overall goals and values. Whether you're an aspiring entrepreneur, a business professional, or simply someone interested in understanding how the world works, strategic management provides a powerful framework for making sense of the complexities of organizations and their interactions with rest of the society.

### What You'll Learn

In this lesson, we'll explore the fundamental concepts of strategic management, including:

*   **Foundational Perspectives:** Reconciling fit, five forces, blue ocean, and resource-based views of strategy.
*   **Emergent Strategy:** Understanding strategy as a combination of planning and learning.
*   **Critical Business Choices:** Designing effective strategies to create and capture value.
*   **Making Strategic Choices:** Evaluating trade-offs and aligning decisions with long-term goals.

### How You'll Learn

This is a flipped classroom, which means you'll be actively engaged in applying and analyzing concepts during our in-class sessions. To prepare for this lesson, you've already completed the following:

*   Read the assigned reading "Introduction to Strategy."
*   Taken the online quiz to test your understanding of the reading.
*   Watched the assigned videos featuring Steve Ballmer's reaction to the iPhone launch and Herb Kelleher's insights on Southwest Airlines' culture.

Building on this foundation, we'll engage in interactive activities, discussions, and analyses to deepen your understanding and develop your strategic thinking skills.
