## Introduction

Building on our introduction to external analysis, this lesson focuses on Porter's Five Forces framework, a cornerstone of industry analysis. This framework, developed by Harvard Business School professor Michael E. Porter, provides a structured approach to understanding the competitive intensity and attractiveness of an industry. 


In this lesson, we'll explore each of the five forces in detail:

*   **Threat of New Entrants:** How easy or difficult is it for new companies to enter the industry?
*   **Bargaining Power of Suppliers:** How much power do suppliers have to influence prices and terms?
*   **Bargaining Power of Buyers:** How much power do customers have to negotiate prices and terms?
*   **Threat of Substitutes:** Are there alternative products or services that could meet the same customer needs?
*   **Rivalry Among Existing Competitors:** How intense is the competition among existing firms in the industry?

By understanding these forces, you can gain a deeper understanding of an industry's profit potential and develop strategies to enhance your company's competitive position.

This lesson builds on the concepts introduced in the "Introduction to Strategy" lesson and reading, particularly the ideas of competitive advantage, business models, and the business landscape. We'll also be applying the six-step industry analysis process detailed in the "Industry Analysis" reading.

## Simple Application Activity: Generative AI Industry Analysis

This activity challenges you to apply the concepts of industry analysis to the "Generative AI Industry". You'll work through the first two steps of the six-step framework introduced in the reading: "Define the Industry" and "Identify the Players." Then, you will identify how different concepts discussed in the reading apply to the generative AI industry.
