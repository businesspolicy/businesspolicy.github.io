### **Required Preparation**

Before this activity, please complete the following:

1.  Read the assigned reading "Introduction to Strategy".
2.  Complete the corresponding Canvas quiz.

This is a fun and engaging idea for a simple application activity!  It's like a pub trivia night, but with a focus on strategic management concepts. Here's an evaluation and some ideas for improvement:

**Evaluation:**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Engaging Format:** The pub trivia format is inherently interactive and encourages friendly competition.
    * **Application Focus:**  It directly aligns with the goal of helping students apply concepts to real-world examples.
    * **Accessibility:** Providing access to the video, notes, and transcripts caters to different learning styles.
    * **Collaboration:**  Encouraging group discussion promotes peer learning and collaborative problem-solving.
    * **Individual Accountability:** Calling on individual students to present answers ensures active participation.

* **Areas for Improvement:**
    * **Clarity of Connection:** While the activity connects concepts to the video, it might be helpful to explicitly state how each batch of questions relates to specific learning objectives.
    * **Challenge Level:** Consider including a mix of difficulty levels in the questions to cater to different levels of understanding.
    * **Visual Aids:**  Incorporating visuals (e.g., screenshots from the video, diagrams) could enhance engagement and comprehension.
    * **Reflection:**  Adding a brief reflection component at the end could help students solidify their learning and identify areas where they need further clarification.

**Ideas for Improvement:**

* **Explicitly link questions to learning objectives:** For example, before each batch, state, "These questions will help you apply your understanding of [specific concept/framework] to analyze [specific aspect of the video]."
* **Vary question difficulty:** Include some easier recall questions alongside more challenging application or analysis questions.
* **Use visuals:**  Project screenshots or short clips from the video to illustrate key points or provide context for the questions.
* **Add a reflection component:**  Have students write a short reflection on what they learned from the activity and any remaining questions they have.

By incorporating these enhancements, you can create an even more effective and engaging simple application activity that helps students connect theory to practice in a fun and memorable way.
