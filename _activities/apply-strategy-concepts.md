Can you create two pub trivia-style questions that connect content from the video to each of the concepts from the list below?

- Internal fit and external fit
- Porter's five forces
- Creating blue ocean
- Emergent strategy

Here are two pub trivia-style questions for each concept, connecting content from the video to internal fit, external fit, Porter's Five Forces, creating blue ocean, and emergent strategy:




### Value Creaation and Value Capture

Here are 5 pub trivia-style questions that relate the concepts of value creation and value capture to the information in the sources about Southwest Airlines:

Question 1:

Which of the following actions by Southwest Airlines most directly contributes to increasing customer willingness to pay (WTP)?

A. Minimizing turnaround time to maximize aircraft utilization.
B. Negotiating favorable contracts with labor unions to control costs.
C. Offering a fun and engaging in-flight experience with friendly service.
D. Operating from secondary airports to reduce congestion and delays.
Answer: C

Explanation: A fun and engaging in-flight experience can differentiate Southwest Airlines from competitors and enhance the perceived value of their service for customers, potentially leading to higher WTP. While operational efficiency and cost control are important, they primarily impact supplier opportunity cost (SOC), not necessarily WTP.

Question 2:

Southwest Airlines' strategy of offering consistently low fares, often comparable to the cost of driving, primarily targets which element of the value wedge?

A. Increasing WTP by offering premium features and amenities.
B. Reducing SOC by minimizing operational costs and maximizing efficiency.
C. Capturing a larger share of the value created by reducing competition.
D. Shifting industry boundaries to create a new market space with less rivalry.
Answer: B

Explanation: Southwest Airlines' emphasis on low fares aligns with a strategy of reducing SOC. By streamlining operations, minimizing expenses, and maximizing aircraft utilization, they can offer affordable prices while maintaining profitability.

Question 3:

Southwest Airlines' decision to avoid interlining agreements with other airlines, while potentially limiting customer flexibility, allows the company to:

A. Increase WTP by offering a more seamless travel experience.
B. Reduce SOC by avoiding the complexities and costs associated with coordinating with other carriers.
C. Capture more value by reducing the bargaining power of complementary services.
D. Reshape the industry landscape by creating a new standard for air travel.
Answer: B

Explanation: The decision to forgo interlining agreements contributes to Southwest Airlines' low-cost structure by simplifying operations and reducing the need for coordination with other airlines, ultimately reducing SOC.

Question 4:

Which of the following threats to sustainability, as described in the sources, poses the most significant risk to Southwest Airlines' ability to capture value over time?

A. Imitation: Competitors adopting similar low-cost models and eroding Southwest's competitive advantage.
B. Substitution: The emergence of high-speed rail or other ground transportation alternatives that offer comparable convenience and affordability.
C. Holdup: Labor unions demanding higher wages and benefits, potentially increasing Southwest's operating costs.
D. Disruption: New technologies, such as electric aircraft or autonomous flight systems, radically transforming the airline industry.
Answer: A

Explanation: The sources highlight imitation as a major threat to sustainability. If competitors successfully replicate Southwest Airlines' low-cost model, it could erode their unique position on the business landscape and reduce their ability to capture value. While the other threats are relevant, imitation represents the most immediate and direct challenge to Southwest's long-term profitability.

Question 5:

Southwest Airlines' focus on building a strong company culture, characterized by employee loyalty and a commitment to customer service, can be seen as an investment in which element of value creation?

A. Reducing SOC by motivating employees to work more efficiently.
B. Increasing WTP by enhancing the perceived value of the Southwest brand and customer experience.
C. Capturing more value by reducing employee turnover and training costs.
D. Reshaping the industry landscape by establishing a new standard for labor relations in the airline sector.
Answer: B

Explanation: A strong company culture that prioritizes customer service can enhance brand perception and create a more positive travel experience, potentially leading to increased WTP. While a positive culture can also contribute to operational efficiency and reduce costs, its primary impact on value creation is through its effect on WTP.

This is a fun and engaging idea for a simple application activity!  It's like a pub trivia night, but with a focus on strategic management concepts. Here's an evaluation and some ideas for improvement:

**Evaluation:**

* **Strengths:**
    * **Engaging Format:** The pub trivia format is inherently interactive and encourages friendly competition.
    * **Application Focus:**  It directly aligns with the goal of helping students apply concepts to real-world examples.
    * **Accessibility:** Providing access to the video, notes, and transcripts caters to different learning styles.
    * **Collaboration:**  Encouraging group discussion promotes peer learning and collaborative problem-solving.
    * **Individual Accountability:** Calling on individual students to present answers ensures active participation.

* **Areas for Improvement:**
    * **Clarity of Connection:** While the activity connects concepts to the video, it might be helpful to explicitly state how each batch of questions relates to specific learning objectives.
    * **Challenge Level:** Consider including a mix of difficulty levels in the questions to cater to different levels of understanding.
    * **Visual Aids:**  Incorporating visuals (e.g., screenshots from the video, diagrams) could enhance engagement and comprehension.
    * **Reflection:**  Adding a brief reflection component at the end could help students solidify their learning and identify areas where they need further clarification.

**Ideas for Improvement:**

* **Explicitly link questions to learning objectives:** For example, before each batch, state, "These questions will help you apply your understanding of [specific concept/framework] to analyze [specific aspect of the video]."
* **Vary question difficulty:** Include some easier recall questions alongside more challenging application or analysis questions.
* **Use visuals:**  Project screenshots or short clips from the video to illustrate key points or provide context for the questions.
* **Add a reflection component:**  Have students write a short reflection on what they learned from the activity and any remaining questions they have.

By incorporating these enhancements, you can create an even more effective and engaging simple application activity that helps students connect theory to practice in a fun and memorable way.
