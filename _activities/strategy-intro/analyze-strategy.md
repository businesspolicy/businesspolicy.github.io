**Description:** In this activity, we'll use the example of Microsoft's response to the iPhone to understand how business landscapes can shift and how companies must adapt to maintain a competitive advantage.

**Learning Objectives**

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

*   Explain the concept of a business landscape and how it can change over time. 
*   Analyze a company's strategic position within a business landscape. 
*   Identify the impact of external forces on a company's competitive advantage. 
*   Apply key strategic management concepts to a real-world case study.
*   Collaborate with your team to analyze and solve a business problem.
*   Communicate your insights effectively to the class.

**Steps:**

1.  **Video Analysis:** Watch the two assigned videos featuring Steve Ballmer's reactions to the iPhone.
2.  **Group Discussion:** Discuss the following questions with your team:
    *   **Initial Landscape:** Using the business landscape metaphor from the reading, describe the key elements of the landscape before the iPhone launch. Consider factors like customer preferences, competitive dynamics, and technological trends. 
    *   **Ballmer's Remarks:** Why do you think Steve Ballmer made the remarks he did in the first video? How did his perception of the landscape influence his assessment of the iPhone? 
    *   **Shifting Landscape:** How did the iPhone change the business landscape? What new customer needs emerged? How did competitive dynamics shift? 
    *   **Microsoft's Response:** How did Microsoft respond to the changing landscape? Was their response effective? What were the limitations of their initial response? 
    *   **Key Concepts:**  Apply relevant concepts from the reading to analyze this scenario. Consider concepts like:
        *   Value creation and value capture 
        *   Customer willingness-to-pay and supplier-opportunity-cost 
        *   Business model: Fit and trade-off 
        *   Strategic Management Approaches: Internal and external fit, five forces, blue ocean strategy, resource-based view and emergent strategy,
        *   Dynamic Consistency: Holdup, Imitation and substitution 

3.  **Presentation:** Prepare a short presentation summarizing your analysis and key takeaways. Share your insights with the class. (Slides are not expected or required. Just organized talking points to convey your insights would suffice.) 

**Self-assessment:**

*   Active participation in group discussions.
*   Depth and clarity of analysis presented to the class.
*   Effective application of strategic management concepts.
*   Individual accountability through observation and potential follow-up questions.
