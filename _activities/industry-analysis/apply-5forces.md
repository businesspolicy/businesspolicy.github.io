### Simple Application Activity: Analyzing the Generative AI Landscape

**Description:**

This activity challenges you to apply the concepts of industry analysis to the dynamic world of generative AI. You'll work in teams to define the industry, identify key players, and analyze how various industry analysis concepts manifest in real-world discussions.

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

*   Define the boundaries of the generative AI industry.
*   Identify the key players in the generative AI industry.
*   Apply industry analysis concepts to a real-world scenario.
*   Collaborate with your team to analyze and synthesize information.
*   Communicate your insights effectively to the class.

**Steps:**

1.  **Video Review:** Watch the two assigned videos on the generative AI industry.
2.  **Group Discussion:** Discuss the following with your team:
    *   **Industry Definition:** Based on the videos and your understanding of the industry, define the boundaries of the "generative AI industry."
        *   What specific products or services are included?
        *   What are the key customer needs being met?
        *   Refer to the industry analysis reading (Section 2.4.1) and consider factors such as customer needs, customer groups and alternative technologies (Derek Abell's three dimensions).
    *   **Identify the Players:**
        *   Who are the key players in this industry? Use five forces methodology to identify them.
        *   The videos focus on the AI business interests of Google and Nvidia and highlight various supplier, customer, competitor, and complementor relationships.
        *   Create a map of these relationships. You may notice that any pair of companies may share more than one relationship. For example, Google is both a supplier and a competitor to Apple. Record these relationships. 
        *   Can you identify different business models prevalent across this industry landscape?.
    *   **Concept Application:** How do the following industry analysis concepts manifest in the videos?
        *   Willingness-to-pay
        *   Supplier opportunity costs
        *   Five forces (rivalry, threat of new entrants, threat of substitutes, bargaining power of buyers, bargaining power of suppliers)
        *   Entry/exit barriers
        *   Switching costs
        *   Vertical integration
        *   Cost structure
        *   Industry growth
        *   Product differentiation

3.  **Class Discussion:** Engage in a class discussion to share your team's findings and insights.

**Remember:** This is an in-class learning activity designed to facilitate discussion and deepen your understanding. The primary deliverable is a rich and interactive discussion within your group and with the class.

**Self-assessment:**

* Active participation in group discussions.
* Clarity and accuracy of the industry definition and player identification.
* Depth and relevance of concept application to the video content.
* Effectiveness of the presentation in communicating insights.
