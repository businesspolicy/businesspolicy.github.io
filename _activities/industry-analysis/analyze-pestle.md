# PESTLE Analysis: Identifying Macro-Environmental Influences

**Description:**

This activity challenges you to apply the PESTLE framework to the generative AI industry, drawing insights from a real-world interview and your own research. You'll work in teams to identify key PESTLE factors, analyze their potential impact, and consider their implications for strategic decision-making.

**Learning Objectives:**

By the end of this activity, you will be able to:

*   Identify and analyze relevant PESTLE factors for a specific industry.
*   Evaluate the potential impact of PESTLE factors on industry dynamics and company strategies.
*   Connect PESTLE analysis to core strategic concepts like customer willingness-to-pay (WTP) and cost structure.
*   Conduct research and synthesize information from various sources.
*   Collaborate with your team to analyze and communicate insights.

**Description:**

The video is an interview with Lina Khan, the chair of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), discussing the role of government regulation in the age of AI. Khan argues that the government needs to take a more active role in regulating the tech industry to prevent anti-competitive practices and protect consumers. She highlights the challenges posed by AI, such as data scraping and the potential for AI models to be used to discriminate against or exclude certain groups. Khan also discusses the FTC's efforts to address these challenges, including scrutinizing mergers and acquisitions in the tech industry and proposing rules to ban non-compete clauses.
