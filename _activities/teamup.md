    * **Major:** Your declared major or area of specialization.
    * **Conversation Starter:** An interesting fact, skill, or interest you want to share.

2. **Strategic Grouping:**  Please get out of your seats and mingle, using your cards to find other "companies" and individuals who would make good strategic allies for a project team. Consider factors like:
    * Complementary strengths (diverse majors)
    * Potential for synergy and innovation (shared interests or complementary companies)
    * Shared values or goals
