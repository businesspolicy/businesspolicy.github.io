### Learning Activity: Applying Global Strategy Concepts to Business Cases

**Learning Objectives:** Upon completion of this activity, you will be able to:

* Identify and explain different strategies for global value creation.
* Analyze a company's scope decisions in a global context.
* Evaluate the factors influencing a company's location choices for its global activities.
* Determine and assess a company's mode of entry into international markets.
* Discuss the potential impact of the timing of a company's international expansion.
* Apply the concepts of global value creation, scope, location, mode, and time of entry to analyze real-world business situations presented in video format.

**Instructions:**

1.  **Watch the Videos:** Watch the following two videos carefully:
    * [Video 1](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MOreJAyfUUU)
    * [Video 2](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mcMNXNhhBuE)

2.  **Apply the Concepts:** For each video, analyze the business situation described using the following concepts from the "Competing Globally" reading. **Make sure to refer to specific elements or examples from the video in your analysis where relevant.**

    * **Global Value Creation:**
        * Based on what you observe in the video, how does the company create value for its customers on a global scale? Does the video highlight any specific ways they deploy, develop, or deepen their value creation activities across borders?
        * What aspects of the company's operations, as shown in the video, suggest a competitive advantage in the global market?
        * Does the video provide any examples of how the company leverages its resources and capabilities across different countries?

    * **Scope Decision Analysis:**
        * What is the geographic scope of the company's operations as depicted in the video? Which countries or regions are mentioned or shown? What might be the reasons behind this scope based on the video's content?
        * What products or services does the company offer globally, according to the video? Does the video suggest any adaptation of these offerings to local markets?
        * Does the video provide any insights into the company's decisions about which activities they perform themselves and which they outsource or partner on in a global context?

    * **Location Choice Analysis:**
        * Where does the video show the company locating its key activities (e.g., production facilities, offices, research centers)? Are there any clues in the video about the factors that influenced these location choices (e.g., location characteristics, firm fit, competitive effect, or incentives)?
        * Based on the video, does the company seem to concentrate its activities in a few key locations or disperse them more widely? What might be the rationale behind this approach as suggested by the video?

    * **Mode of Entry Analysis:**
        * How did the company appear to enter the international market(s) based on the information presented in the video? Can you infer their mode of entry (e.g., exporting, foreign direct investment, partnerships) from what is shown?
        * Based on the video, what seem to be the advantages or disadvantages of their chosen mode of entry in their specific industry and context?
        * Does the video hint at any changes in their mode of entry over time?

    * **Time of Entry Analysis:**
        * Does the video provide any information or clues about when the company entered the international market(s)? Were they an early or late mover in their industry?
        * Based on the video's narrative, what might have been the advantages or disadvantages of their timing of entry? Consider the market conditions and competitive landscape suggested by the video.

3.  **Discussion:** After analyzing both videos, be prepared to discuss your findings with your classmates. Compare and contrast the global strategies of the companies in the two videos, making specific references to what you observed in the videos to support your points.


**Remember:** This is an in-class learning activity designed to facilitate discussion and deepen your understanding. The primary deliverable is a rich and interactive discussion within your group and with the class.

**Self-Assessment:**

* Active participation in group discussions
* Clarity and accuracy of the competitive advantage analysis
