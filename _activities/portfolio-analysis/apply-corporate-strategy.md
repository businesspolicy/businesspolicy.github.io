### Learning Activity: Applying Corporate Strategy Concepts to Ford Motor Company

**Learning Objectives:** Upon completion of this activity, you will be able to:

* Analyze a company's portfolio decisions, including which businesses to own, control, and exit, and how they achieve synergy.
* Evaluate a company's scope decisions, such as backward integration, forward integration, and horizontal diversification.
* Identify and assess a company's mode of entry decisions, including alliances, joint ventures, and long-term market relationships.
* Discuss a company's governance decisions, such as centralization vs. decentralization, autonomy vs. coordination, and the role of organizational culture.
* Apply the concepts of portfolio decisions, scope decisions, mode of entry decisions, and governance decisions to analyze the corporate strategy of Ford Motor Company as presented in the videos.

**Instructions:**
